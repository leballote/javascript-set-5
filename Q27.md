1. `[] + []` :
   The result is `''`, because both arrays get coerced to primitives and `ToPrimitive([]) = ''`, after that it is straight forward.
2. `{} + []` : Depending on the engine implementation of the engine, the term `{}` can treated as a block of code with nothing inside in some situations, and the whole statement becomes `+[]`, and the unary operator `+` casts to number, and `ToNumber([]) = 0`, endsup beign the final result of the whole statement. In most cases though, it is the sum of an object with an array, both get casted into primitives, and `ToPrimitive({}) = '[object Object]'`. Therefore the sum ends up being `'[object Object]' + '' = '[object Object]'`.
3. `[] + {}` : Just as with the previous case, the sum is equivalent to `'' + '[object Object]' = '[object Object]'`.
4. `{} + {}` : As in the previous case, the first pair of curly braces can be treated as a block of code, in that case the sum becomes `'[object Object]'`, in every other case it is the sum of two objects which sums to `'[object Object][object Object]'`.
